# html-pong-game
1. **Background:**
This is one of my most memorable memories of IT. This single problem changed my perspective of IT and opened my eyes to the capabilities that lie within IT. In highschool I was tasked to build a game, I decided to build it in delphi at the time, success everything worked but how whould I show off to my friends?
2. **Problem**
Find a way to build a mobile friendly pong game without using large IDEs (I had a slow computer at the time).
3. **Solution**
Build the game in browser and Learn the terrible truth of java vs javascript😢
Use html, javascript and css to build the game use vs code as the IDE.
4. **Solution Approach**
- index.html: would be the body of the program and the application essentially.
- index.js: is the mechanics of the game, such as the collision detection mechanic, movement mechanic and so on.
- styles.css: is the art and the sexy of the program.
