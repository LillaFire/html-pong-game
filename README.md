# html-pong-game
1. **Background:**
This is one of my most memorable memories of IT. This single problem changed my perspective of IT and opened my eyes to the capabilities that lie within IT. In highschool I was tasked to build a game, I decided to build it in delphi at the time, success everything worked but how whould I show off to my friends?
2. **Problem**
Find a way to build a mobile friendly pong game without using large IDEs.
3. **Solution**
Build the game in browser and Learn the terrible truth of java vs javascriptðŸ˜¢
Use html, javascript and css to build the game use vs code as the IDE.
4. **Solution Approach**
- index.html: The main body of the program.
- index.js: is the mechanics of the game, contained the movement function, event listeners, score system and so forth.
- styles.css: is used to stylize the background and create a border.
